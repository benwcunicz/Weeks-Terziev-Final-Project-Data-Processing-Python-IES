To install, download the zip file via github (or use git clone) and then cd to the directory where the src files for the project are downloaded at on your local system and then type: "pip install -r requirements.txt" (without the quotation marks). Make sure you have ALL the dataset files downloaded and in the same directory as the python source code files. Make sure you have at least python 3.12 installed and pip version 23.3.2.
